    "<p>The best values of x and y are x=0 and y=20, meaning all money should be spent reducing the probability of transmission. The working for this can be seen below where the average number of contacts infected by each infected person is calculated. This is also known as the basic reproductive number and as the model is that of a simple branching process, we can calculate this as the probabilty of transmission x the number of contacts met by an infected person during their contagious period. We wish to minimise this value in order to minimise the spread of the disease (as a basic reproductive number less than 1 in the branching process means the disease can only spread for a finite number of waves), and we find the optimal value to be 0.8 when x=0 and y=20. In order to further prove this, a simple simulation was conducted beginning with 1 infected person and infecting each of 40-x/2 contacts with probability 0.04-y/1000 per infected person per wave, with 25 waves in total. The percentage of the total population to become infected was then measured, and the minimal value was found to be 2.46% of the population at x=0 and y=20. In this case the simulation was run 10 times per combination of x and y values to ensure average values were used instead of potential outliers.</p>"
